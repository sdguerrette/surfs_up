# SurfsUp

## Overview
This analysis was undertaken at the request of W. Avy in order to check the feasibility of opening his Surfs UP Ice Cream and Surf shop on the Hawaian Island of Oahu. Specifically, Mr. Avy needed to know whether the year-round temperatures on the island would be able to support a shop that relies so heavily on good weather. To undertake this analysis, we utilized temperature observation data from a range of weather stations across the island and calculated summary statistics for the months of June and December, as these should give us a good idea of the typical hottest and coldest temperatures that the shop will have to operate through.

 - As seen in the above images, both months reach very similar high temperatures, with only a 2 degree difference measure between June and December
 - Minimum temperatures between the months showed more variance, with an 8 degree difference measured.
 - Most importantly, mean temperatures between the two months were fairly close, with a mean of 74 degrees in June, and 71 degrees in July. 
## Summary
Based on the above findings, we believe that the potential for success of Mr. Avy's shop should not be limited by temperatures vairance across the different seasons. WIth mean temperatures above 70 degrees for June and December, we believe that the sun and warmth required for surfing and ice cream consumption should be present enough for the shop to succeed in the winter months and excel in the summer months. However, we believe it wuold be in the best interest of Mr. Avy and his investors to conduct further analysis on the data to ensure our conclusions are indeed correct. For one, we reccommend combining the above temperature data with precipitation data to discover if the two are correlated. We also believe that curating the list of stations that produce the temperature data to onlcy include those stations on or near the coast would be benificial. This will allow us to focus on the most relevant data by removing data points that represent substatntially different conditions (such as higher altitudes) than those near where the shop would be placed.
